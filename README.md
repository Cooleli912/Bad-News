# THIS IS OUTDATED, I HAVE FOUND A WAY!
The following bad news has passed, I have returned to github.


# Bad News

I'll be leaving Github, and moving on, because I am required to enable two factor authenication, but, I can't, so I can no longer post here, for new content, go to http://www.eelonline.us/

I'll post my projects and my blogs there, the website needs remastered, but that won't take long.

See you there!
